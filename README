A time picker for jQuery UI

This is a simple time picker that creates a autocomplete combobox using the dates and times specified. 
You can give it a range, an array, an ajax source, whatever.

It is based off on the timePicker by Anders Fajerson (http://perifer.se) and works a lot like the google
calendar time picking widget.  It is unintrusive and degrades to just a text input.
